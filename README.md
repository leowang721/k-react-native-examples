## Usage

The Scripts is the same as any project which was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Try executing `yarn start` (`npm start` if without `yarn`), then Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

Use phone to see the actual view, then read the note to understand it.
